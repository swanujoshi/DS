1. Install Java (if not installed)

Before running the server and client, ensure that Java is installed on your machine.

sudo apt update
sudo apt install default-jdk
java -version

2. Compile Java Files

Compile the Java source files by navigating to the directory where the .java files are located, and run:

javac *.java

3. Start RMI Registry

RMI requires the RMI Registry to be running for the client and server to communicate. Start the RMI Registry with the following command:

rmiregistry &

If the above command fails, you can kill any lingering rmiregistry processes:

ps
kill <PID>
rmiregistry &

4. Run the Server (Terminal 1)

Now, you can run the server in the first terminal. Navigate to the directory containing the server code and run:

java Server

5. Run the Client (Terminal 2)

Finally, open a second terminal and run the client. Make sure the client code is in the same directory as the compiled files.

java Client
